# Introduction

It happened suddenly; I just stopped listening to music. Almost stopped, because I sometimes listen to hip hop and techno. But this transformation happened to me over a couple of years. I used to want to be a musician, but now the guitar disgusts me. It's like the trigger from the book A Clockwork Orange, except that the protagonist felt sick when he saw violence. But what happened to me? That's what this article is about.

## The first chord

I was born into a non-musical family; my parents were ordinary working people. Therefore, I did not attend music school. But I had other hobbies — action movies on VHS, later computers, then a love of cyberpunk and science fiction. By nature, I am a techie; I like to tinker with all kinds of programs.

But as a teenager, my tastes changed dramatically—I discovered rock, and then metal. And then, when a music teacher came to our college, I decided that I wanted to learn the guitar to become like my idols at the time—Tony Iommi, Dave Mustaine, and Alexi Laiho. Kerry King. Miller Petrotza, Max Cavalera, Robb Flynn. These names should be familiar to fans of thrash metal.

Then I discovered music software and the ability to write music using a computer and guitar. This became my passion for many years, then a couple of thrash metal projects appeared, the last of which I recently closed. I never had any desire to play with anyone else; I never cared about performing on stage. I just loved playing guitar and using my computer. Because you can do all kinds of crazy things on a computer. Just look at what Celldweller creates.

## Loser with a guitar

Throughout this time, failure followed me everywhere. And I think my attitude towards songwriting contributed to this. First of all, I hate the simple Russian phrase “from the heart” with every fiber of my “soul,” the existence of which I don't believe in. Secondly, my approach to songwriting has always been technical. I always prioritized rhythm and groove, completely disregarding melody, soulfulness, and all that nonsense that spiritual people love. Because I am an atheist and a materialist, I reject any “spirituality” and idealism!

My music lessons were like a protest against the very idea of music. Because I always compared composing to programming. And I always wanted to spit in the faces of academics, telling them that their Wagner and Tchaikovsky were shit, and that they were a bunch of assholes and snobs! This sparked my interest in boom bap, drum ‘n’ bass, and techno. Because this music has always been associated with technology. Sampling, synthesizers, modules, etc. When I saw a man on Instagram writing music on a huge box covering the entire wall, where he was turning some knobs, switches, etc., I was blown away. After that, I fell in love with techno and drum ‘n’ bass — actually, I loved them before, but this video inspired me.

The same goes for hip hop — there is a huge selection of samplers, as well as beatmakers, each with their own style and most of whom have no musical education. That's what I needed, because this kind of music shows the superiority of technology over playing Chopin at the conservatory. And the style of producers such as RZA, Stu Bangas, Al Chemist, Dj Premiere, and 9th Wounder is impossible to confuse with anyone else's. These guys survived in the ghetto, often without access to education, but they beat any intellectual playing two-hundred-year-old junk!

## From “musician” to developer

I have never been a musician in the literal sense of the word. That is, I have no musical education. Everything I did was based on my love for the music I listen to. Therefore, I wanted to create a mix of what I love, because I have always considered the division of music into a bunch of genres to be unnecessary. Electronic music can be divided into techno, trance, house, and drum and bass. Within these styles, there are melodic (liquid, deep) and heavy (neurofunk, gabber, breakcore) genres. The same applies to other genres - rock, metal, jazz, hip hop, etc.

My approach to composing music has always been focused on technology. That is, I wrote music the way I write code now. Riffs as modules, then project assembly and rendering. Three main steps in the development of any project.

So when I reached catharsis, burned out, and all my creativity was killed, I grabbed onto development like someone falling into an abyss grabs onto the first branch they can find to save their life. I was trying to preserve my mental health. There are small perks that music gave me. Otherwise, it was a waste of money on equipment, sleepless nights writing a new track, and hoping that “now it will take off.”

It didn't take off, and to hell with it!

## Conclusion

Would I like to write again? Maybe. But I'm burned out inside. Inside me there is emptiness, ruins, I no longer want publicity and to remain in this image of a creator trying to change something in this world with the help of music. It's just a useless endeavor - all this musical activism.

You can look at RATM and a bunch of other left-wing bands and see what they've become over the past couple of decades — ordinary commercial acts with guitars or samplers, simply hiding behind left-wing flags and slogans. I'll be more useful if I go work on some decentralized project building a Web3 application or VPN than if I write songs.

So I sold my guitar and said “no” to music!
