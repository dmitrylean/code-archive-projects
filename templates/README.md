## ðŸ”¹ HTML/CSS

The `html-css` folder contains:

- Basic HTML5 structure.
- Included `reset.css`.
- Simple grid and typography styles.
- Example JavaScript connection.

**Run:**

Open `index.html` directly in your browser
_or_ use a local dev server (e.g., VS Code Live Server).

---

## ðŸ”¹ React

The `react` folder contains a clean **Create React App** setup:

- Standard `/src` and `/public` structure.
- React 18.
- ESLint with a base config.

**Run:**

```bash
cd react
npm install
npm start
```

## ðŸ”¹ WordPress

The `wordpress` folder is a minimal WordPress theme:

- Prepared template files (`header.php`, `footer.php`, `index.php`, etc.).
- Pre-built blocks for quick HTML-to-WP integration.
- Styles and scripts already enqueued.
- Template parts split into manageable chunks.

**Setup:**

1. Copy the `wordpress` folder to `/wp-content/themes/` in your WP installation.
2. Activate the theme via **Appearance â†’ Themes**.
3. Start integrating your HTML/CSS into the ready-made blocks.
