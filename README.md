# ⚡ Crash The Routines (Astro)

📚 **Crash The Routines** is a personal codebase, UI library, and frontend development reference, hosted on **Astro**.
The project features mockups, ready-made interface blocks, mini-projects, and articles to speed up development and share best practices.

## 💡 Project Idea

This repository is more than just a collection of demos or templates.
Here I store my own layout projects (**HTML/CSS/JS**), which I use as a **codebase** and knowledge base.

When I looked through repositories with HTML projects, many of the codes were outdated and confusing.
So, I decided to gather everything that has happened over the past year in one place—in a modern format and with a clear structure.

**Crash The Routines** was conceived as a reference guide where you can quickly find out how to create a specific block, add a necessary function, or view the logic of a component.
Simply put, it's my personal "developer's field kit,"
which over time has evolved into a full-fledged open source project.
